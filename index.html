                    Hello, my name is Armando and I have created this website as part of my first homework from the SMU Coding Program. The present theme is made up of 3 parts. The first page, is this site (index.html), which includes a navigation bar in the top with some hover effects, a main content section, where this information is being displayed (About Me), and a basic footer with an achor link, to return to this homepage everytime that is clicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second page is called portfolio, in there, I have include some random pictures that represent future projects that I will develop during this academic program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the last part of this Website is a contact section, where, I have added a simple contact form so people who have questions about my projects can reach out to me. Overall, this is what this website is all about. Thank You for reading.
                </p>
